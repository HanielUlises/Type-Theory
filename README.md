# Type-Theory

I love logic and computer science >.<

This is my personal repository where I'm exploring and learning about type theory. So far, I've covered:

- [Natural Numbers](./Natural%20Numbers)
- [Typability Constraints](./Typability%20Constraints)
- [Type Inference](./Type%20Inference)

This is mainly for educational purposes and serves as my personal exercise in understanding type theory fundamentals. Feel free to explore!
